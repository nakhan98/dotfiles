In order to effectively evaluate all aspects of the UnixHub schism, one has to first go back to the very beginning of UnixHub itself.
Beginning

UnixHub was formed in mid-late 2012 by “Beastie” (now yrmt) and “jjumbii” (now jmbi). When yrmt came to jmbi with the idea of forming a new community centered around Unix customization and use, jmbi provided an IRC server and maintained it along with yrmt. The next step was thinking of a community name. Some of the earliest members thought of “UnixHub” on jmbi's IRC server. These members included but are not limited to:

    Beastie
    jjumbii
    Amzo
    Jolia
    NeoTerra
    crshd
    bottomy
    Test-Run
    shix
    Joomla
    gurhush
    Jayro

The domain unixhub.net was purchased by NeoTerra shortly after and pointed to Jayro's web server. With the sudden influx of users, Jayro helped jmbi in configuring a new IRC daemon and thus, Jayro and jmbi were the only two IRC operators.
The Golden Age

The golden age of Unixhub was the entire year of 2013. The forums were growing in numbers, the IRC channel was a mecca for Linux/Unix users and things were going great.
The Beginning of The End

I'm not sure when exactly, but with more and more IRC traffic the idea of a server node in Europe became increasingly appealing. Yrmt contacted jmbi and he trusted yrmt's judgement so they linked IRC servers with <honestly can't remember>. After hearing about this, NeoTerra, furious that no one told him, demoted yrmt on the forums and on IRC. The servers unlinked and there was a subtle tension in the channel from then on.

Around the beginning of January 2014 a new member named “bosko” showed up in the IRC channel. Because of his overall unethical behavior and attraction to teenage girls, he was disliked by the majority of the channel. Jayro was no longer active on the channel, so the only IRC oper was jmbi. The channel ops at this time were NeoTerra, shix, BigE, crshd, and a few others that I can't recall. Around this time many new influential new members showed up as well like dcat, dami, vypr, and others. Bosko frequently challenged the authority of jmbi and the rest of the channel ops, so jmbi took an interest in the security of the server and told NeoTerra this. After spending weeks in IRC with dcat, jmbi contacted dcat privately and asked him if he could find vulnerabilities in the IRC server and fix them. In a shared tmux session, jmbi and dcat improved the security of the IRC server as much as they could. After doing this, NeoTerra contacted jmbi much in the same way as he had with yrmt before, and was very upset that jmbi never told NeoTerra about fixing vulnerabilities with dcat. Jmbi apologized and explained his reasoning.
The End

This was late January 2014 to early February. After improving the security of the IRC server, things were seemingly going good in IRC and on the forums. Until one morning where NeoTerra sparked the end. Jmbi received a text from dcat while he was at school eating lunch: “hey jmbi, what happened man?” Not having any idea what dcat was talking about, he asked and got a reply: “NeoTerra is giving everyone a new IP for the IRC server, he's telling everyone to switch to his server because yours is not secure.” Jmbi was completely blindsided and quickly realized that NeoTerra was eliminating yet another founding father from the collection of UnixHub's assets. NeoTerra owned the domain and after this stunt, he would completely control the IRC server as well. That night the community was completely split in half because of NeoTerra's stunt. Many realized exactly what NeoTerra was doing and knew it was wrong. Yrmt and jmbi (the two founding fathers of UnixHub) had their own community taken right from under them. Well played NeoTerra, well played. As any dictator would, NeoTerra quickly labeled dcat, jmbi, yrmt, dami, vypr, bosko, and others as enemies of UnixHub who were trying to split the community apart. Knowing this was not the case, they continued to fight for getting UnixHub back.
